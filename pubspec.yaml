  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#fonts:
#  - family: Muli
#    fonts:
#      - asset: assets/fonts/muli/Muli.ttf
#      - asset: assets/fonts/muli/Muli-Bold.ttf
#        weight: 700
#      - asset: assets/fonts/muli/Muli-Light.ttf
#        weight: 300
#      - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
